## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

Comparing the three images shown below, I can also look at the video link to see a more intuitive change in its dynamics, which utilises **only circles** in its shape, but with **randomly generated paths** of circles changing all the time. These techniques are regularly drawn in specific areas, and then follow **different paths** to eventually reveal a clear image of the whale. I like the simplicity of this artwork without losing the creativity, that I can apply these technical inspirations to the 'Saint Georges majeur au cr√©puscule' and they will blend nicely.

### Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
- One technique is able to **draw circles in random positions** in the canvas, giving set colours and sizes and generated positions, and perhaps achieve this step of generating with random circles like the inspiration.

- Another is to generate a shape that **moves on a curve**. While generating circles, circles needs to move **towards the boundaries** of the different coloured elements within the artwork. This coding technique only moves one circle in one curve, to achieve what is shown in the video in Part 1, more curves and paths data need to be calculated.
